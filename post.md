📌
👋 Hey Product Hunt!

Emmanuel here, co-creator of Remention, and I'm excited to be back launching another product here!


The problem
After launching our previous product Bestregards, we got some traction and wanted to invest in social media. However, we struggled! It all seemed overwhelming and time-consuming, yet we knew it was crucial for reaching new audiences and growing a brand.

We thought there had to be a better-optimised way to leverage AI for engaging with relevant conversations without getting lost in the noise.

So we built Remention.

Our solution
Remention scans billions of online discussions with advanced scraping, crawling, and data extraction capabilities. It does this across multiple social media channels: Reddit, Twitter(X), LinkedIn, Bluesky, Threads, and Facebook.

Then it identifies the best places to mention your product based on your product description and relevant keywords.

Then Remention helps you seamlessly join in the conversation with natural, authentic replies! With knowledge of your product information and the social media post, it crafts an engaging reply that adds value to the conversation and also plugs in your product for visibility.

It's like having a super-smart friend who knows exactly when and where to chime in and include your product online.

How does it help?
🔎 Pick the keywords you want to monitor

Select the keywords that matter most to your product, and Remention will track them across all major social media platforms: Twitter(X), Facebook, Reddit, Bluesky, Linkedin and Threads!

🖲️ Real-Time Tracking
